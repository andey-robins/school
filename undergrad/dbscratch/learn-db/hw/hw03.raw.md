# Interactive - 03 - Select data back from the table

Data is more fun when you can put some in and get it 
back later.  Enter "select".

```
m4_include(hw03_1.sql)
```

gives you get back all the data.  The `*` is the list
of columns you get back.  `*` is for all the columns.

```
m4_include(hw03_2.sql)
```

Gives you back just the name and state.

```
m4_include(hw03_3.sql)
```

Gives you back a lower case version of the name.

Or make it in order from z to a.

```
m4_include(hw03_4.sql)
```

Maybe we just want the names in Wyoming.  This is the
where clause.

```
m4_include(hw03_5.sql)
```

Remember that if you want to match a text field you
have to use quotes.  Also it is case sensitive.

```
select real_name
from name_list
where state = 'wy'
;
```

will not give you any rows.  Try it.

The query to run before to get your grade is:

```
m4_include(hw03_5.sql)
```

It should return 3 rows.  This is what is checked for by the application.
