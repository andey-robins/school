# Interactive - 21 - select with union / minus

You can concatenate results with a "UNION" between two selects.  This can be kind of like a full join
but instead of getting back nulls you can fill in values that you like.

```
	SELECT t1.name as "Employee Name", 'No Departmnt' "Department Name", t1.pay "Year Pay"
	FROM employee as t1
	WHERE t1.department_id is null
UNION
	SELECT 'No Name' as "Employee Name", t2.dept_name as "Department Name", 0.0 "Year Pay"
	FROM department as t2 
ORDER BY 1
;

```

You should get back 4 rows.
