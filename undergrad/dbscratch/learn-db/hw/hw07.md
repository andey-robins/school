# Interactive - 07 - add a check constraint on age

We can use the Data Definition Language (DDL) - create table to check
that values are in a correct range or value.

These are check constrains.

Let's save our data for later, then recreate the table.

First we are going to rename the table - so we can save 
it for later.

```
DROP TABLE if exists old_name_list;
ALTER TABLE name_list
	RENAME TO old_name_list;

```


Now we will re-create the table with the check constraint.

```
create table name_list (
	real_name text,
	age int check ( age > 0 and age < 154 ),	
	state char varying (2)
);


```

Now copy the data back.  

```
insert into name_list ( real_name, age, state ) 
	select real_name, age, state 
	from old_name_list;

```

Verify data amount.  Check how many rows.

```
select count(1) from name_list;
select count(1) from old_name_list;

```

Provided that the counts are the same let's clean up the temporary table with the old data. 

```
drop table old_name_list;
```

And let's look at the data.


```
select * from name_list;

```

You should see 11 rows.  The duplicate should be removed.
