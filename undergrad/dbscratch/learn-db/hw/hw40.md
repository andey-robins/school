# Interactive - 40 - refresh materialized view

Last time we created a materialized view, `count_by_state_of_names`.

This time let's refresh it with new data.

```
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW count_by_state_of_names;

```

Materialized views don't change when the underlying data changes.  
You have to refresh them.
