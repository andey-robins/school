# Interactive - 05 - insert more data / select unique data

Let's put in some more data - that has some mistakes in it.


```
m4_include(hw05_0.sql)

```

The problem is that "Jane True" is now a duplicate!

Let's see it.

```
m4_include(hw05_1.sql)
```

We will get how to prevent this later.
Right now let's get unique data back when the
actual data has duplicates.   For lots of reasons you 
can get duplicates in a set of selected data.

```
m4_include(hw05_2.sql)
```

The select should return 10 rows of data.

Book: pages 12 to 14.
