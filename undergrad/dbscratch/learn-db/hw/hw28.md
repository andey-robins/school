# Interactive - 28 - 1 to n relationship				(fk)

The simple to understand relationship is a 1 to 0..n relationship.
This is where a parent key is a primary key and a foreign key
is in a 2nd table.  We have this relationship between
`"t_ymux_user"."id"` and the `"t_ymux_auth_token"`.

The table `"t_ymux_auth_token"` has "user_id" as a column in it.
A foreign key relationship exists between the 2 tables.  This means
that you can have more than 1 auth token for each user.   Basically
a user can login from more than one computer at a time.

```
SELECT setup_data_26();

SELECT t1.email, t2.id as "auth_token"
	FROM "t_ymux_user" as t1
		join "t_ymux_auth_token" as t2 on ( t1."id" = t2."user_id" )
;

```

You should get back 3 rows.
