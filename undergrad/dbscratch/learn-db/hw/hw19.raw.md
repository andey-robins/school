# Interactive - 19 - select using sub-query and exists

Let's use some of our joins to delete some data.

Let's get rid of the people that are not in a department.

```
m4_include(hw19_1.sql)
```

You should get back 2 rows.

These rows should be the offending rows with the department-less employees.
