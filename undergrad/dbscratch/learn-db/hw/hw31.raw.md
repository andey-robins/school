# Interactive - 31 - only one row of data				(uk with no sequence)

With system configuration tables it is often useful to only have 1 row of data.
Each configuration item is a distinct column in the table.

This can be done with a primary key and a constraint.     The constraint limits the values
on the primary key and results in an error if a attempt to insert a 2nd row occurs.

In this example we just have `applicaiton_name` as the single configuration item.

```
m4_include(hw31_1.sql)
```

The first insert will work.  Then 2nd will not.

```
m4_include(hw31_2.sql)

```

and 2nd insert

```
insert into ct_config ( application_name ) values ( '4010 blockchain class' );

```

on the 2nd insert you should get an error similar to:

```
psql:hw31_3.sql:3: ERROR:  new row for relation "ct_config" violates check constraint "ct_config_config_id_check"
DETAIL:  Failing row contains (2, 4010 blockchain class).
```

We can prevent delete of the row with a trigger.


```
m4_include(hw31_4.sql)

```

When you try to delete:

```
delete from ct_config;
```

You should get an error similar to:

```
ERROR:  cannot delete configuration row
CONTEXT:  PL/pgSQL function ct_config_prevent_delete() line 4 at RAISE

```
