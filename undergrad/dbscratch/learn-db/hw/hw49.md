# Interactive - 49 - PostgreSQL database maintenance

When a table has a substantial change in size the set of statistics
that are used to create and optimize queries needs to be updated.
This is done with the `vacuum` command.

Also when deletes occur the data is marked as deleted but the space
is not reclaimed.   To reclaim the space you need to run a `vacuum` 
on the table or on all tables.   Because this can be a very time
consuming process this is often set up to run at an off-peek time.

```
vacuum full;
vacuum analyze name_list;

```
