# Interactive - 37 - encrypted/hashed passwords storage

It is a good idea to store passwords in a way that if the entire database is lost
you do not loos anybody's password.  You need to hash them or encrypt them
in the table.

There are hash functions that are designed for this.  Of of these is  
the blowfish algorithm.  It is denoted to in the encryption parameters as 'bf'.


First, we need to enable pgcrypto:

```
CREATE EXTENSION if not exists pgcrypto;

```


Then, we can create a table for storing user credentials:

```

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS example_users ;

CREATE TABLE example_users (
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
	password TEXT NOT NULL
);


CREATE OR REPLACE function example_users_insert()
RETURNS trigger AS $$
DECLARE 
	l_salt text;
	l_pw text;
BEGIN
	select gen_salt('bf')
		into l_salt;
	l_pw = NEW.password;
	NEW.password = crypt(l_pw, l_salt);
	RETURN NEW;
END
$$ LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';


CREATE TRIGGER example_users_insert_trig
BEFORE insert or update ON example_users
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE example_users_insert();


```

When we insert into the table we can then save the hash of the password instead of the
password itself.

```
INSERT INTO example_users (email, password) VALUES 
	( 'pschlump@uwyo.edu', 'my-very-bad-password')
;

```

When we want to validate that a password that has been passed in is correct
we compare to the hashed value with:


```
SELECT id 
	FROM example_users as t1
	WHERE t1.email = 'pschlump@uwyo.edu'
	  AND t1.password = crypt('my-very-bad-password', t1.password)
;

```

This would be a good candidate to encapsulate into a stored procedure.

```
CREATE or REPLACE FUNCTION login_correct ( un varchar, pw varchar )
RETURNS varchar 
AS $$
DECLARE
	data text;
BEGIN

	BEGIN
		SELECT 'VALID-USER'
			INTO data
			FROM example_users as t1
			WHERE t1.email = un
			  AND t1.password = crypt(pw, t1.password)
			;
		IF not found THEN
			data = 'Incorrect username or password.';
		END IF;
	EXCEPTION	
		WHEN no_data_found THEN
			data = 'Incorrect username or password.';
		WHEN too_many_rows THEN
			data = 'Incorrect username or password.';
		WHEN others THEN
			data = 'Incorrect username or password.';
	END;

	RETURN data;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

select login_correct ( 'pschlump@uwyo.edu', 'my-very-bad-password' );

select login_correct ( 'pschlump@uwyo.edu', 'my-VERY-bad-password' );
