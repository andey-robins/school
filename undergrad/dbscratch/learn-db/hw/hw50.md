# Interactive - 50 - Geometric Data / PostGIS

PostgreSQL also has a substantial set of constructs that allow both indexing and data storage of points.
Collectively these base capabilities are built into a very good Geographic Information System, PostGIS.

PostGIS adds all sorts of fun stuff like projections and data for all the counties in the US.

Before using PostGIS you need to understand the basics - like points and lines and that PostgreSQL
can store and search spacial data.
