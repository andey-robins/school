# Interactive - 34 - explain

First you have to understand that different queries will work and perform in different 
ways.  The biggest thing is the query hitting an index.  That is not the only thing.

```
m4_include(hw34_1.sql)
```

v.s.

```
m4_include(hw34_2.sql)
```

both produce the same results.  The first one will construct the set of data from the
join and then filter it for the user.  An index will not be used because of the `or` and 
the `null`.

The 2nd one pre-filters the table `ct_homework_graded` for just the single user.  Since this is
an equal condition an index will be used and this smaller set of data then is then
used in the join.

First setup the tables and data for this  by running `hw34_5.sql`.

A better implementation of the 2nd form is (run file `hw34_3.sql`):

```
m4_include(hw34_3.sql)
```

This removes the now unnecessary query to check that it is a valid user id (on ct_login)
and uses a `with` to set up the per-user set of data.

The question is now how to figure out what the query planner is doing and what queries
need to be optimized.
