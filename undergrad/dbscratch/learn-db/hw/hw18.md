# Interactive - 18 - More joins (full joins)

## Full Join

This is more of a concatenation of rows of data.

![Full Outer Join](PostgreSQL-Full-Outer-Join.png)

```
SELECT t1.name as "Employee Name", t2.dept_name as "Department Name", t1.pay "Year pay"
	FROM employee as t1
		FULL JOIN  department as t2 on ( t1.department_id = t2.department_id )
;

```

You shoudl get back 9 rows - note where the NULL values are.


## Full Outer Join - Unique to Both tables Rows

You can also use the join to find the rows that are unique in each table.

![PostgreSQL Inner Join](PostgreSQL-Full-Outer-Unique-Join.png)


```
SELECT t1.name as "Employee Name", t2.dept_name as "Department Name", t1.pay "Year pay"
	FROM employee as t1
		FULL JOIN department as t2 on ( t1.department_id = t2.department_id )
	WHERE t1.name is null 
	   OR t2.dept_name is null
;

```

You should get back 3 rows.
