# Interactive - 48 - window functions

Window functions allow operations of a set of data.  First let's setup an example.


```
m4_include(hw48_1.sql)
```

A window function can be used to calculate the sum of salary across each department. 
This start with the `OVER` operator and a expression of how the data is to be grouped.


```
m4_include(hw48_2.sql)
```
