# Interactive - 37 - encrypted/hashed passwords storage

It is a good idea to store passwords in a way that if the entire database is lost
you do not loos anybody's password.  You need to hash them or encrypt them
in the table.

There are hash functions that are designed for this.  Of of these is  
the blowfish algorithm.  It is denoted to in the encryption parameters as 'bf'.


First, we need to enable pgcrypto:

```
m4_include(hw37_1.sql)
```


Then, we can create a table for storing user credentials:

```
m4_include(hw37_2.sql)
```

When we insert into the table we can then save the hash of the password instead of the
password itself.

```
m4_include(hw37_3.sql)
```

When we want to validate that a password that has been passed in is correct
we compare to the hashed value with:


```
m4_include(hw37_4.sql)
```

This would be a good candidate to encapsulate into a stored procedure.

```
m4_include(hw37_5.sql)

```
