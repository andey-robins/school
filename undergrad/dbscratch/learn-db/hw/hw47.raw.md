# Interactive - 47 - NoSQL databases ( mongoDB ) v.s. JSONb in PostreSQL

One of the most common alternatives to a SQL database is MongoDB.
Front end developers like MongoDB because everting is in JSON.

There are two reasons why I don't use MongoDB.

1. Concurrency control is incredibly important.  Google reviewed
its code base and counted the number of defects related to bad 
implementations of custom concurrency control.   The problems
were bad enough that Google banned the use of MongoDB.
2. Everything that can be done in MogoDB can be done just as
fast using JSONb data in PostgreSQL.  Also with PostgreSQL
you get a complete relational database with tables and
indexes and spacial data and...   That other stuff just
get thrown in.

So... Let's look at how to use JSONb in PostgreSQL.

First let's create a table.  This is the same as creating a "collection" 
in MongoDB.  The table will use a GIN index to index all of the 
data in the JSON data.  (Run file `hw47_1.sql`)

```
m4_include(hw47_1.sql)
```

PostgreSQL has a slew of operators.

For example:

```
m4_include(hw47_2.sql)
```

Should return 1 row the name equal to `bob`.
