# Interactive - 07 - add a check constraint on age

We can use the Data Definition Language (DDL) - create table to check
that values are in a correct range or value.

These are check constrains.

Let's save our data for later, then recreate the table.

First we are going to rename the table - so we can save 
it for later.

```
m4_include(hw07_1.sql)
```


Now we will re-create the table with the check constraint.

```
m4_include(hw07_2.sql)

```

Now copy the data back.  

```
m4_include(hw07_3.sql)
```

Verify data amount.  Check how many rows.

```
m4_include(hw07_4.sql)
```

Provided that the counts are the same let's clean up the temporary table with the old data. 

```
drop table old_name_list;
```

And let's look at the data.


```
m4_include(hw07_5.sql)
```

You should see 11 rows.  The duplicate should be removed.
