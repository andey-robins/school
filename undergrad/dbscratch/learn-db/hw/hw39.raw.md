# Interactive - 39 - materialized views

One of the ways that you can improve performance in PostgreSQL and other SQL databases is a materialized view.
A regular view is a kind of "macro" that replaces the query's from with the body of the view.  

In a materialized view the data itself is copied into the "view" and you can add indexes and other things
that optimize queries on this set of data.

The downsize to materialized views is that the data can get out of sync with the original data.

Materialized views are very useful when the source of the data is a foreign data wrapper.  Especially
when the foreign data is slow or only periodically changes.

Let's use our table with some names in it. (From Interactive Homework 08)

Run File `hw39_0.sql`:

```
m4_include(hw39_0.sql)
```

First let's refresh the data in name_list so that we know what is in it.

Run File `hw39_2.sql`:

```
m4_include(hw39_2.sql)
```


Now a materialize view that rolls up the count of the number of names in each state.

```
m4_include(hw39_1.sql)
```

To refresh a materialized view you use (you need to do a refresh to populate the view for the first time also):

```
m4_include(hw39_5.sql)
```

Now let's select the data:

```
m4_include(hw39_3.sql)
```

You should get back 3 rows.
