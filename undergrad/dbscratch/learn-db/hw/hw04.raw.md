# Interactive - 04 - update the table

Note that we have an error in our data.  `Bob true` should
be `Bob True`.   Let's change some data.

```
update <tabe-name>
	set <list of columns to modify>
	where <boolean expresison>
;
```

so... let's look at the data before the update

```
m4_include(hw04_1.sql)
```

Update it to fix it

```
m4_include(hw04_2.sql)
```

Now let's look at the data:

```
m4_include(hw04_3.sql)
```

Much better!  The query should return 6 rows.  The application checks that you are getting back 6 rows
of data for grading.

Book: page 139 talks about update.
