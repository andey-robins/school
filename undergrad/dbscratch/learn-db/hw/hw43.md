# Interactive - 43 - indexes on functions - soundex 

You can create indexes on the output of functions then use this
to quickly lookup a row that matches.  An example of this is
soundex - a fuzzy match for a name that is based on a phonetic
lookup.

Note: If you need to have an effective name lookup there are
better functions for this - search for `fuzzy-match  postgresql`
and there is a built in library - but the other fuzzy match
functions are much more complex.

Another example would be an upper or lower case function 
applied to a text field.

This example is the how-to build an index using a function.
So...

The function is...


```
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION soundex(input text) RETURNS text
IMMUTABLE STRICT COST 500 LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
	soundex text = '';
	char text;
	symbol text;
	last_symbol text = '';
	pos int = 1;
BEGIN
	WHILE length(soundex) < 4 LOOP
		char = upper(substr(input, pos, 1));
		pos = pos + 1;
		CASE char
		WHEN '' THEN
			-- End of input string
			IF soundex = '' THEN
				RETURN '';
			ELSE
				RETURN rpad(soundex, 4, '0');
			END IF;
		WHEN 'B', 'F', 'P', 'V' THEN
			symbol = '1';
		WHEN 'C', 'G', 'J', 'K', 'Q', 'S', 'X', 'Z' THEN
			symbol = '2';
		WHEN 'D', 'T' THEN
			symbol = '3';
		WHEN 'L' THEN
			symbol = '4';
		WHEN 'M', 'N' THEN
			symbol = '5';
		WHEN 'R' THEN
			symbol = '6';
		ELSE
			-- Not a consonant; no output, but next similar consonant will be re-recorded
			symbol = '';
		END CASE;

		IF soundex = '' THEN
			-- First character; only accept strictly English ASCII characters
			IF char ~>=~ 'A' AND char ~<=~ 'Z' THEN
				soundex = char;
				last_symbol = symbol;
			END IF;
		ELSIF last_symbol != symbol THEN
			soundex = soundex || symbol;
			last_symbol = symbol;
		END IF;
	END LOOP;

	RETURN soundex;
END;
$$;
```

You should already have the function loaded.  This function should be setup as part of your account
so you should not need to run it.  The file if it is not there is hw43_1.sql.

To create the index:

```
CREATE INDEX name_list_func_soundex ON name_list (soundex(real_name));

```

Then to query on this field:


```
SELECT * 
	FROM name_list 
	WHERE soundex(real_name) = soundex('philip schlump')
;

```

This will use the output from the function to do the query.  This makes for a fast lookup.
