# Interactive - 20 - delete with in based sub-query

Let's use some of our joins to delete some data.

We will recreate the data from homework 17 again.  The file is hw17_1.sql

```
m4_include(hw17_1.sql)
```


Let's get rid of the people that are not in a department.

```
m4_include(hw20_2.sql)
```

It should delete 2 rows.

There are performance reasons to use either exists or in.  Exists combines the queries and is better when the tables are similar in size.
In is usually better when the left table is much smaller than the parent table.  In results in the inside query running to completion
before the outside query.
