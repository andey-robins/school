# Interactive - 35 - views

The database can create a pre-defined select called a view.
A view is a query that you set up that looks like a table when selected from but
can be a join or other set of operations.  It is kind of like a query-macro.

For example we can create a view that let's us list the unused indexes.

This is the file hw35_1.sql.

```
m4_include(hw35_1.sql)
```

Then when we want the list of unused indexes we just select from the view.


```
m4_include(hw35_2.sql)
```
