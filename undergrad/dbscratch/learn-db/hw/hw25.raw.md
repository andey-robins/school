# Interactive - 25 - drop cascade 

You can drop a table or other database object.  This destroys it.
PostgreSQL provides the ability to do the "drop" but only if
the object exists.


```
drop table name_list;
```

Will error if the object is not there.

```
m4_include(hw25_1.sql)
```


Drop can also detach a table from the set of constraints that it
may have.  This is the "cascade" option to remove foreign
key constraints.  Do note that in Oracle this will drop
additional tables - not just constraints.  Take care with
"cascade".


```
m4_include(hw25_2.sql)
```


Let's re-create our tables at this point so we have fresh
data for future homework problems.

Run the file to re-create : hw13_4.sql

drop table if exists us_state cascade;
