# Interactive - 27 - 1 to 0 or 1 relationship 			(fk, unique)

Now that we have our tables let's look at the relationship between
`"t_ymux_user"` and `ct_login`.   This is our 1 to 0 or 1 relationship.

It is provided by the primary key on ct_login being required but not
having a default value where a key is generated.   This is combined
with the foreign key constraint to `"t_ymux_user"`.

Try an insert to see if you can fake it out (the insert will fail).

```
insert into ct_login ( user_id, pg_acct ) values ( uuid_generate_v4(), 'x' );

```

You should get an error.   The error indicates that you violated a foreign key and will look similar to:

If you ran it in psql or pgAmdmin your error would look like:

```
ERROR:  insert or update on table "ct_homework_ans" violates foreign key constraint "user_id_fk"
DETAIL:  Key (user_id)=(ce1d8fdd-aa04-4bb4-9ef7-72655ff63b95) is not present in table "ct_login".
CONTEXT:  SQL statement "insert into ct_homework_ans (
		user_id,
		homework_id
	) select
		NEW.user_id,
		t1.homework_id
	from ct_homework as t1
	where not exists (
			select 1 as "found"
			from ct_homework_ans t2
			where t2.user_id = NEW.user_id
			  and t2.homework_id = t1.homework_id
		)"
PL/pgSQL function ct_login_ins() line 3 at SQL statement
```

In this tool you get back:

```
{
    "Status": "error",
    "MsgSet": [
        {
            "Msg": "pq: insert or update on table \"ct_homework_ans\" violates foreign key constraint \"user_id_fk\"",
            "Stmt": "insert into ct_login ( user_id, pg_acct ) values ( uuid_generate_v4(), 'x' )"
        }
    ]
}
```
