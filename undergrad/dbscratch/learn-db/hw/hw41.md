# Interactive - 41 - case/when - if in projected columns

You can change the return values in the projected columns.

For example if you want to map certain values to new values in a query.
An example with the name_list table is to create a new column that is
an in-Wyoming column.


```
SELECT
		  t1.real_name
		, t1.state
		, case
			when t1.state = 'WY' then 'y'
			when t1.state is null then 'n'
			else 'n'
		  end as "in_wyoming"
	FROM name_list as t1
;

```
