# Assignment 1 - Install PostgreSQL and tools

We will be using Python in this class.  I use Anaconda python and the example install is for Anaconda python.
Any Python 3.7 or newer should work.    Specif sections are presented based on the OS that you are running
on.  For example, with an install of Anaconda python on a Mac you already have python 2.7 installed and you
need to change your PATH to find the newer 3.8.x Anaconda python instead.

The set of tools that we will be using are:

1. Python
2. A python package, bottle
3. A python interface to PostgreSQL, psycopg2
4. The ability to generate UUIDs in Python, uuid
5. PostreSQL 13.x
6. pyAdmin
7. PostGIS 3.x
8. Redis 3.x
9. Git 2.x
9. A text editor (vi or vim will work, Windows notepad is insufficient, Mac textedit is insufficient)  You can use the editor in Visual Studio Code but care must be taken.   We will be using `.csv` files in this class and you don't want to edit your .csv's in Excel or in the Visual Studio  Spreadsheet Plugin.  You will want to edit
them as text (Don't just double click on them!)
10. Make
11. Command line tools, ls, cat, etc. (on windows you get these when you install git)

The example OS installs will be Windows, Mac and Ubuntu(Debian) Linux.  I have tried all of this
using Windows 10 Unlimited, MacOS Big Sur and Ubuntu Linux 20.04.  If you are using a different
OS let me know - we can probably work it out (For example if you are using Debian on a Raspberry PI
all of this will work - but you probably need a Pi 4 with 16 gig of memory).
