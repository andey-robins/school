# Phase 1: QR Code Services

Features that are not available in QR services today:
- Association of extended data with QR code
- Different URLs that are redirected based on time of day, date and other time factors
- Use of 2nd factor authentication with a QR code
- Monitoring of destination URLs for availability
- Redundant redirection of URLs when the primary is not available
- QR Codes acting as an active tool that generates an activity - like sending email or activating an IoT device.

Features that are not commonly available today:
- Tracking the number of references, time and other attributes used by a QR code
- High redundancy in QR codes by using a URL shorter
- Pre-Generation of QR codes that can be redirected later (This allows for pre-printing of QR codes)
- QR Codes as a Service

- Take .pdf or other document and create a .pdf that has a QR code (header) and a checkable signature
- PGP signatures
- ETH signatures
