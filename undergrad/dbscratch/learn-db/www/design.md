CRUD at RestAPI level



You will need to install PostgreSQL on your computer - if you can't do that
then we can work out using PostgreSQL on a free-tier Amazon AWS Linux system
or on a google computer cloud system.   Another alternative is setting it
up and running PostgreSQL on a Digital Ocean "droplet" for $5.00 a month
(about $15 to $20 for the semester).

I have build a "tool" for you to interactively work with some of the class
material.  This will allow you to cover some of the SQL syntax.  This is
about 1/2 of the class - for the other `1/2 you need to have your own
install of PostgreSQL. 

We will have regular "discussion" group meetings - your attendence is
required.  I have 3 times for a 1-hour discussion each week.  You must
attend 12 discussions during the semester. 
This means that there are 15 weeks times 3 times or 45 avalable discussions
and you must attend 12 hours of them.

Discussions - These are about 1/2 lecture - and 1/2 us talking through
how and why it is important and how it works.

1. How modern apps work.
2. How to choose a database.  - Pros and cons of SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis.
3. How to choose an applicaiton layer.
4. What is ACID compliance - why is it important.
5. Backup and the law - Business contunity
6. Blockchain as a Database (the thing under crypto currencies)
7. Testing with a database.  Traditional approaches.
8. Local vs. global optimization
9. Secuirty and "injection attacks"
10. How to port to a new database
11. Procedural v.s. Functional - why testing with a database is hard.
12. Future of datbase - cloud and it's impact.
13. What's wrong with ORM.
