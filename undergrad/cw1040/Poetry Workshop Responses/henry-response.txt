1. The Speaker of this poem is describing the inevitability of death. Throughout
the poem, it explores and reveals the nature of the guarantee of death. When discussing
the images and stories surrounding death, it takes the past tense form, but when
discussing death, it's in the present tense. The poem moves from this assertion
that life is only in the pursuit of death before concluding with questions about
the nature of death.

2. The feeling I got reading this poem was inevitable foreboding. Similar to the
existential dread you can experience when contemplating death, but with more zen
notes. I think rooting the poem in more concrete imagery could be a good way to
give it more punch. To include those images, I think you could explore some of
the images we traditionally associate with death, skulls, cemeteries, things of
that nature.

3. The emotional argument seems to me to be that death is inevitable, but what
does it really mean? The questions at the end of the poem "Where do they go? What
can be expected in death?" Serve to undermine the certainty that I found presented
in the rest of the poem.

4. I really liked the mixing of tenses where you say things such as "animals fed
on dead flesh" but "Death is final." It helps to sell the infinite temporal nature
of death, which seems to be a key aspect of the poem.

5. I'm curious about the title. Loss conjures up much different images in my mind
than the ones that are explored in this poem. When I think loss, I usually think
of things like emptiness, being alone, and feeling disconnected, but this poem
pushes far more into the idea of death than the title Loss conjures up for me.
