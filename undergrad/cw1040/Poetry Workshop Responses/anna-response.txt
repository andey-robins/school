1. The Speaker in this poem is discussing the nature of memories themselves, but
it is unclear exactly who they are. It feels as though not much is revealed, but
instead we are carried through these images of time that the Speaker is reliving.
The poem is set in the second person, having the Speaker address the reader directly
in the present tense. The poem changes from the beginning to end by moving from
the abstract concept of memories that change, to grounding the reader in specific
memories of the Speaker before finishing with the assertion that memories change
with the passage of time, as is revealed in the first line and in the title.

2. I think poetry is inherently about presenting difficult topics in a simplified
structure. I don't think you tried to take on too much at all. The ending reminded
me of clich√©s surrounding memories, rose tinted glasses, and the positive light we
look on the past with, but that seems to be the purpose of this poem. It's painting
the beautiful parts of the passage of time. I felt as though each image was barely
explored and only painted in a couple words. The most vivid image was the one I
dwelled on the longest, the night in the backyard, simply because it lasted the
longest in the poem.

3. It feels as though the emotional urgency is building to some sort of nihilistic
revelation about the nature of memories, since you use language like "burning,"
"evaporating," "swallowed," and "deadened." We seem to hit a turning point where
the Speaker says "But you never forget..." that begins to paint the poem in a
more optimistic light, before the conclusion that they "always grow sweeter"
which leads to the conclusion that this poem is highlighting the emotional, and
positive, nature of the memories that don't ever leave us.

4. The title is what most excited me. I read it and was immediately intrigued as
to how this motif would play out throughout the poem, and then when it was the
first line, it made the poem feel open and accessible, as if I was already partial
through reading it even though I just started. That was a good feeling for someone
who struggles to read poetry since it feels so hard to start.

5. I'm concerned that there were so many images, and yet I only remember one of
them distinctly. If I were to revise this piece, I would try to nail down two or
three total images that I wanted to vividly paint and make certain that a reader
would finish reading my poem and have those images etched on the back of their eyes.
