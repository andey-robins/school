1. The idea that hardware implementation of computers is imperative is something that struck me as novel. 
After I thought about it for a moment, it was obvious that this would be the case; 
that's how machine code functions of course, but without it being explicitly stated, I had never previously made that connection.

2. The concept of a programming language that exists only as a series of descriptions of the result is and
entirely new concept to my mind. It didn't think it possible for a computer to "search up" a result without it
being told how to come to that solution. I'm curious to learn how these langauges are put together by comptuer scientists.

3. The three different approaches to semantics of programming languages is an interesting concept. I had previously
only thought in terms of operational semantics (I think, their differences are still a bit ambiguous to me) and
the concept of breaking the type of description of programming langauges into multiple categories is fascinating.
