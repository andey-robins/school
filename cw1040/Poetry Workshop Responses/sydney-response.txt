1. The Speaker is describing two people, a man and a woman. The Speaker seems to
be leading us through one of the man's memories about the woman in a third person,
past tense perspective. The man then steals a cigarette from his father and sits
out in the overcast weather smoking. In the beginning of the poem it's about the
memories of this woman, before being thrown into a picture of the man for the last
half of the poem.

2. I think the poem is about a man reminiscing over a woman that he has lost. But
frankly, I'm very confused about what's even happening in the poem. It took me
several reading to understand that the man in line 1 is also the him in the third
stanza. I also don't understand what purpose the indentations are serving. If I
had to point at one thing and say I hate it, it's that I can't understand the
purpose of this form decision.

3. It didn't feel to me as though there was any urgency about this poem. Other
than the man being the same throughout the stanzas, they all felt very disconnected
as though there were parts of different poems. As a result, I struggled to feel
any sort of emotional arc or imperative within the piece. Perhaps the urgency is
a sort of anti-smoking message? That seems to be the repeated motif throughout
the poem.

4. I really liked the clear structural definition that the tabs provided. I'm a
huge fan of using form to help tell the narrative of a piece, and I would love to
see that be used to help pull the meaning out of the poem.

5. I think my main concern is that the images within this poem don't seem to have
a reason to be together right now. They're great images, and they feel fully realized
to me, but they feel unconnected and disjoint. If I were to look at revising
this piece, I would be really concerned about getting those images to all help
each other out.
