1. The Speaker in this poem is some unnamed person, but it appears that they
are speaking from beyond the grave, or from beyond the life, of the reader.
Perhaps they have died or simply they have moved out of the reader's life. Regardless,
it is clear that they are gone. Over the course of the poem, I believe we see the
reveal of what it is like to grow distant from the loss of the poem. The first
half feels like the recent feelings of the loss and the second half is a more
divorced time. The poem seems to reveal how those feelings may grow and change
as time moves forward. It is told in the first person, present tense.

2. If your poem is about loss, specifically death, I think it's perfectly clear.
If it's not about loss at all, then I was unclear on what the poem was about. As
far as too much being unsaid, I don't think that's anything to worry about in this
poem. Personally, I found it to be quite vague, and so I projected much of my own
feelings onto the poem as I read it; for better or worse, it felt as though I was
being primed by the words on the page to view my own life instead of seeing a
single, clear point from the Speaker.

3. I read the emotional issue at stake in the poem as the idea that loss never
is truly gone. The lines "the anguish plagues / your feelings faded by the years"
seems the most prescient in regards to the emotional theme. They evoke images of
loss becoming less all consuming, but no less painful. The ending of "Now, I am
only your pictures." Has that melancholy feeling I associate with losing a dear
friend.

4. I was really excited by how short you made very line. They're all parts of one
or two sentences, and yet they all stand so alone on the page that I can't help
but dwell on each of them individually. Your decision to also not include really
any punctuation makes the entire piece feel as though it's part of a single thought,
and I appreciate that feeling.

5. As I mentioned above, this felt a little bit too vague for me. If I were to
look at revising this piece, I would try to place in a few more pieces of imagery;
I feel that having a clear picture to envision can help the reader arrive at the
feelings you want to inspire within them with a piece of writing.
